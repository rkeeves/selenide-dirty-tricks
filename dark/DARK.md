# Dark side

I call these sections the `dark side`, because all of them do **nasty, evil and crazy things**. It is basically tampering with things that were not meant to be tampered with.

> **Reading these sections will not solve your issue.** These will simply demonstrate dirty tricks you can do. I'm not advising you to do X or Y. All of the tricks have weaknesses and sometimes a pretty huge tradeoff.

Here's the `dark side`, the hacked, discouraged way of things:
- [Why did the chicken cross the road?](Chicken.md)
- [That spinner could work though... Right?](Spinner.md)
- [Is there a ready-to-go solution?](Primefaces.md)
- [Is there a javascript function I can use?](JsFunctions.md)
- [Can I wait with the driver?](ManualJs.md)
- [Can I wait with a custom Command?](Command.md)
- [Can I use a custom Condition for waiting?](Condition.md)
- [Can I communicate to fellow testers my intent via the type system?](CommunicatingIntent.md)
- [Can I use listeners for waiting?](Listeners.md)
- [Can I preattach listeners to drivers by factory?](DriverFactories.md)
- [Can I override Click?](MutatingCommands.md)
- [Can I keep the old Click?](CustomInterfaceForDynamicProxy.md)
- [Can I create my own SelenideElement without Dynamic Proxy?](BoilerPlateWay.md)
- [Can I represent widgets as wrappers?](WidgetWrappers.md)
- [Can I communicate that I'm testing?](Locating.md)
- *In theory you can also use a proxy to have a greater control over xhr and resulting changes, but that was simply too dirty even for my curiousity.*
- *You can also use Chrome Dev Tools, or BiDi of Selenium but that will couple you to a specific browser.*
